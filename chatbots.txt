Brainstorming
Brainstorming is a method for generating a large number of ideas quickly, without evaluating them initially
Steps of brainstorming
Define the Problem: Clearly state the challenge or objective
Gather Participants: Work with a group or alone
Generate Ideas: Write down or share as many ideas as possible No idea is too wild or impractical at this stage
Encourage Building: Build on others' ideas and encourage creative thinking
Review Ideas: After the session review the list and refine or prioritize the most promising ideas.




Mind Mapping
Mind Mapping helps organize thoughts visually showing the relationships between different ideas
Steps of Mind Mapping
Start with a Central Idea: Write your main concept or problem in the center of a page
Add Branches: Draw lines outward from the central idea, each representing a related sub-idea
Expand: Add additional branches and sub-branches to explore further details and connections
Review and Organize: Look over the map to identify patterns or key areas of focus.





SCAMPER:
Introduction: SCAMPER is a technique for improving or innovating an idea by considering different modification prompts
Steps of SCAMPER:
Select an Idea: Choose an existing product or concept
Apply SCAMPER Prompts:
Substitute: What can you replace in the idea?,
Combine: What if you combine it with another idea?,
Adapt: How can you adjust it for better results?,
Modify: What changes can enhance it?,
Put to Another Use: How can it be used differently?,
Eliminate: What can be removed to simplify?,
Reverse: What if you reverse its process or components?,
Generate Ideas: Use the prompts to develop new ideas or improvements.




Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Diagram):
Introduction: The Fishbone Diagram helps identify the root causes of a problem by visually mapping out potential causes
Steps of Fishbone Diagram:
Draw the Diagram: Create a large arrow pointing to the problem statement at the head of the diagram
Identify Main Categories: Draw main branches off the arrow for major categories of causes
Add Sub-Causes: Add smaller branches for sub-causes related to each main category
Analyze: Review the diagram to identify and address root causes.





Role Storming:
Introduction: Role Storming involves thinking from different personas’ perspectives to generate unique ideas
Steps of Role Storming:
Identify Roles: Choose different roles or personas related to the problem
Assume Roles: Think and brainstorm as if you are each role
Generate Ideas: Develop ideas based on the perspective of each role
Review: Collect and assess ideas from different perspectives




Affinity Diagrams:
Introduction: Affinity Diagrams help organize and categorize ideas into groups based on their relationships
Steps of Affinity Diagram:
Collect Ideas: Write each idea on a separate sticky note
Group Ideas: Place the sticky notes on a wall or surface and group similar ideas together
Identify Themes: Organize these groups into broader themes or categories
Analyze: Review the grouped ideas to identify key patterns and insights.




6 Thinking Hats:
Introduction: The Six Thinking Hats technique involves examining a problem from six different perspectives to gain a comprehensive view
Steps of 6 Thinking Hats:
Understand the Hats: Familiarize yourself with each hat’s perspective:
White: Facts and data
Red: Emotions and feelings
Black: Risks and problems
Yellow: Benefits and positives
Green: Creativity and alternatives
Blue: Process and organization
Adopt Each Hat: Discuss the problem while focusing on the perspective of each hat
Generate Insights: Collect and integrate insights from all hats.




Reverse Brainstorming:
Introduction: Reverse Brainstorming involves thinking about ways to worsen a problem to uncover potential solutions
Steps of Reverse Brainstorming:
State the Problem: Define the problem you want to address
Consider How to Worsen It: Brainstorm ways to make the problem worse
Reverse Solutions: Take each worsening idea and reverse it to find possible solutions
Evaluate: Assess the reversed ideas for feasibility and effectiveness.





How Might We (HMW) Questions:
Introduction: How Might We (HMW) questions reframe problems into opportunities for creative solutions
Steps of How Might We (HMW) Questions:
Define the Problem: Clearly state the challenge you are facing
Reframe as HMW Questions: Turn the problem into “How might we” questions that focus on potential solutions (e.g., “How might we improve customer satisfaction?”)
Brainstorm Solutions: Generate ideas in response to each HMW question
Prioritize: Evaluate and prioritize the most promising ideas.




Design Thinking:
Introduction: Design Thinking is a user-centered approach to solving problems through empathy, ideation, and prototyping
Steps of Design Thinking:
Empathize: Research and understand the users’ needs and experiences
Define: Clearly articulate the problem or challenge based on user insights
Ideate: Brainstorm a wide range of ideas and potential solutions
Prototype: Develop simple models or prototypes of the best idea
Test: Gather feedback from users on the prototypes and refine the solutions based on their input.


Ideation is the process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, It’s a crucial phase in problem-solving, innovation, and creative projects, aiming to explore possibilities and develop solutions to specific challenges and it includes Idea generation,Idea development,Problem solvings.
Example Problem Statement:
"Small local businesses often lack the resources to build an effective online presence and compete with larger e-commerce platforms. Our solution is to create an easy-to-use e-commerce platform specifically designed for local businesses to set up and manage their online stores with minimal effort."
