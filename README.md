# Startup-Ideation-Bot-Jamie
Jamie - The Ideation Chatbot
Jamie is an interactive chatbot designed to help you with ideation and design thinking. It leverages natural language processing to engage in meaningful conversations and provide assistance based on user inputs.

# Features:
1. Greets users and responds to greetings.
2. Processes and responds to user inputs based on contextual similarity.
3. Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to understand and generate responses.
# Getting Started
### Prerequisites :
 Python 3.11 or later
 ## Required libraries (listed below)
1. numpy
2. nltk
3. scikit-learn
# What the Chatbot Answers
The chatbot can handle a variety of interactions, including:
- Greetings: It recognizes and responds to common greetings like "hello," "hi," "greetings," etc.
Contextual Responses: The chatbot generates responses based on the content of a provided document (in this case, 'chatbots.txt'). It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to understand the user's input and find the most relevant response from the document.
- Ideation Techniques: While the provided code is a basic implementation, the chatbot can be extended to provide detailed information on ideation techniques such as brainstorming, SCAMPER, mind mapping, etc.
- General Questions: It can answer general questions about ideation and design thinking if the relevant information is included in the document it references.
# How to Use the Chatbot for the Ideation Process
## 1. Setting the Context
- The chatbot uses a provided document ('chatbots.txt') that should contain detailed information on ideation and design thinking.
- This document can include definitions, techniques, examples, and best practices related to ideation.
- Users can update this document with relevant content to improve the chatbot's responses.

## 2. Facilitating Brainstorming Sessions
During brainstorming sessions, participants can interact with the chatbot to:

- Generate new ideas by asking for examples or methods related to ideation techniques.
- Get prompts for different ideation exercises such as SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse).
- Clarify any doubts about the ideation process or specific techniques.
## 3. Supporting Design Thinking Workshops
In design thinking workshops, the chatbot can:

- Guide participants through the different stages of design thinking (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).
- Provide tips and strategies for effective ideation.
- Answer questions about how to apply various design thinking methodologies.
## 4. Continuous Learning and Improvement
- Users can continuously update the 'chatbots.txt' document with new content, allowing the chatbot to provide more comprehensive and up-to-date responses.
-  This adaptability makes the chatbot a dynamic resource for ideation and design thinking.

# Example Interactions
Here are some examples of how the chatbot can be used:

User: Hi, can you tell me about SCAMPER?
Chatbot: Hello! SCAMPER is a brainstorming method that stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse. It helps you generate new ideas by prompting you to think about existing ideas in different ways.

User: What are some techniques for ideation?
Chatbot: Some common techniques for ideation include brainstorming, mind mapping, SCAMPER, and the Six Thinking Hats. Each technique has its own strengths and can be used depending on the context and goals of your session.

User: How do I empathize in design thinking?
Chatbot: Empathizing in design thinking involves understanding the needs, experiences, and emotions of the users you are designing for. Techniques such as user interviews, observations, and empathy maps can help you gain deeper insights into your users' perspectives.
# Installation


``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-for-ideation.git
cd chatbot-for-ideation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
Run the chatbot by executing the chatbot.py script.
``` bash
python chatbot.py
```
# Code Overview
### 1. Import Libraries
Various libraries such as numpy, nltk, string, random, scikit-learn are imported to provide the necessary functionality for the chatbot.

### 2. Read and Preprocess the Document
The chatbot reads the content from a text file ('chatbots.txt') and preprocesses it by converting the text to lowercase and tokenizing it into sentences and words.

### 3. Lemmatization
Lemmatization is performed to reduce words to their base forms, which helps in understanding the context and generating accurate responses.

### 4. Greeting Inputs and Responses
The chatbot can recognize common greeting phrases and respond appropriately with predefined responses.

### 5. Response Function
The response function generates context-aware responses using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compare the user's input with the content of the text file.

### 6. Main Chatbot Loop
The main loop keeps the conversation going until the user decides to exit by typing "Bye". It processes user inputs and provides appropriate responses or greetings.

# Conclusion
This chatbot serves as an interactive tool to support ideation and design thinking processes. By providing contextual responses and guidance on various techniques, it helps users engage in effective brainstorming and design thinking activities. Continuous updates to the underlying document ensure that the chatbot remains a valuable resource for fostering creativity and innovation.
